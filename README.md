# Neural-Networks-with-Pytorch

Here, I have built and trained a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) and explored transfer learning as well as imbalanced datasets for image classification using PyTorch. I trained a CNN for classifying images of dogs into five different breeds: African hunting dogs, Chihuahuas, Dhole, Dingo and Japaneses Spaniel.
